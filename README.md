# Simple To-Do List

This is a basic **To-Do List** web application built using **HTML** , **CSS** and **JS**. It allows users to manually list tasks.

## How to Use

1. Open `to-do list.html` in a web browser.
2. Manually add tasks as needed.


### **Technology Used**

#### **HTML**:
- Used for the basic structure and layout of the to-do list. It provides the container for the task input, list, and buttons.

#### **CSS**:
- **Styling**: Applied styles to the to-do list to make it visually appealing and user-friendly.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the list looks good on various screen sizes by centering the content and providing appropriate padding and margins.
- **Animations**: Used CSS animations for smooth transitions when tasks are added or removed from the list.
- **Alternating Background Colors**: Created a striped effect for the tasks with alternating background colors for odd and even tasks.

#### **JavaScript**:
- **Dynamic Functionality**: Handles adding tasks to the list, ensuring the input is not empty, and dynamically creating list items (`<li>`) for each task.
- **Task Removal**: Allows the user to delete tasks by clicking a delete button, with a smooth fade-out effect before removal.
- **User Interaction**: JavaScript enables the interactive features, including task addition and deletion, without needing to reload the page.
